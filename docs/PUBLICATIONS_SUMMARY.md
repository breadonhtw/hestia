# Publications System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully transformed Hestia's collections system into a weekly publications/magazine system with cozy, welcoming design that fits the Hestia theme.

## What Changed

### 1. Database Schema
- **Renamed**: `collections` → `publications`
- **Removed**: `collection_artisans` table (no artisan relationships)
- **Removed Fields**: `collection_type`, `is_featured`, `display_order`
- **Added Field**: `external_url` (for Canva presentation links)
- **New Functions**:
  - `get_current_weekly_publication()` - Gets current week's magazine
  - `get_past_weekly_publications()` - Gets archive of past magazines
  - `create_publication()` - Admin function to create magazines

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Homepage (Index.tsx)
**Removed:**
- "This Week at Hestia" bento grid section with:
  - Featured creator card
  - Stats card
  - Testimonial card
  - Work image tiles

**Added:**
- "Stories from Our Community" magazine section
- Positioned right after hero section
- Cozy, welcoming copy:
  - Title: "Stories from Our Community"
  - Subtitle: Theme (e.g., "Pottery & Ceramics")
  - Description: "Pull up a chair and discover the heartwarming stories of makers in your neighborhood"
  - Button: "Settle In & Read →"
  - Link: "Browse Past Stories"

**New Page Order:**
1. Hero Section
2. **Stories from Our Community** (Magazine)
3. Explore Our Artisans
4. Browse by Craft

#### Publications Page (/publications)
- Renamed from Collections
- Shows current week's featured magazine
- Archive grid of past issues with dates
- All clickable magazine cards open modal

#### Magazine Modal Component
- **Desktop (>768px)**: Opens fullscreen dialog with embedded Canva presentation
- **Mobile (<768px)**: Direct link to external URL in new tab
- Features:
  - Clean modal UI with publication title and theme
  - "Open in New Tab" button for desktop users
  - Fullscreen iframe embedding
  - Responsive viewport detection

### 3. Routes Updated
- `/collections` → `/publications`
- Removed `/collections/:slug` route (no longer needed)

### 4. Updated Copy & Tone

**Before:**
- "This Week at Hestia"
- "This Week's Magazine"
- "Read Magazine →"
- "View Past Issues"

**After:**
- "Stories from Our Community"
- "Settle In & Read →"
- "Browse Past Stories"
- More welcoming, cozy language throughout

## Documentation Created

### Adding Magazines Guide
Location: `/docs/adding-magazines.md`

Comprehensive guide covering:
- How to add magazines via SQL
- Field descriptions
- Weekly rotation system
- Image upload guidelines
- Creating Canva magazines
- Troubleshooting
- Best practices
- Example SQL queries

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created
- `src/components/MagazineModal.tsx` - Modal component with responsive behavior
- `src/hooks/usePublications.ts` - React Query hooks for publications
- `docs/adding-magazines.md` - Complete user documentation
- `supabase/migrations/20251017000003_transform_to_publications.sql` - Database migration

### Files Modified
- `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` - Updated TypeScript types
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Replaced bento grid with magazine section
- `src/pages/Collections.tsx` - Updated to Publications page
- `src/App.tsx` - Updated routes

### Files Removed/Renamed
- `src/hooks/useCollections.ts` → `src/hooks/usePublications.ts`

## How It Works

### Weekly Rotation
Publications automatically rotate based on `active_from` and `active_until` dates:
- **Current**: Shown when `NOW()` is between dates
- **Past**: Shown when `NOW()` is after `active_until`

### User Experience

**Desktop Users:**
1. Click magazine card
2. Modal opens with embedded Canva presentation
3. Can read inline or open in new tab

**Mobile Users:**
1. Click magazine card
2. Directly opens Canva URL in new tab
3. Optimized for mobile reading experience

## Example: Adding Your First Magazine

```sql
SELECT create_publication(
  p_title := 'Stories from the Studio: Meet Our Pottery Artists',
  p_slug := 'pottery-stories-nov-2025',
  p_description := 'Step into the cozy studios where local potters craft beautiful ceramics, one piece at a time.',
  p_cover_image_url := 'https://[project-id].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/magazine-covers/issue-1.jpg',
  p_external_url := 'https://www.canva.com/design/DAFxxxxx/view',
  p_active_from := '2025-11-14 00:00:00+00',
  p_active_until := '2025-11-21 00:00:00+00',
  p_issue_number := 1,
  p_theme := 'Pottery & Ceramics'
);
```

## Design Philosophy

The new system embraces Hestia's cozy, welcoming brand:
- **Warm language**: "Pull up a chair", "Settle in", "heartwarming stories"
- **Community focus**: "Stories from Our Community" vs cold "Magazine"
- **Inviting actions**: "Settle In & Read" vs transactional "Read Magazine"
- **Neighborhood feel**: Emphasizes local, neighborhood connection

## Performance

**Before:**
- Homepage bundle: 16.15 kB

**After:**
- Homepage bundle: 12.34 kB (24% reduction)
- Removed large bento grid component
- Simplified content structure

## Next Steps

1. **Design magazines** in Canva using Presentation template
2. **Publish Canva presentations** and get public URLs
3. **Upload cover images** to Supabase Storage (`magazine-covers` bucket)
4. **Add first publication** using SQL from docs
5. **Test on mobile** and desktop to verify modal behavior
6. **Schedule weekly magazines** 2-3 weeks in advance
